# Algorithm-Visualizer-using-Java-Swing
A Java Swing program to visualize different Pathfinding and Sorting algorithms

# Description
Algorithm Visualizer is a simple Java Swing application for sorting and pathfinding algorithms. 

Users have the ability to tweak some values including: algorithm being used, size, and the amount of delay.
Users will also have the abilitity to start the algorithm, reset the options values, and clear the panel.

# Algorithms
Sort Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Heap Sort
         
Pathfinding Algorithms: Dijkstra, A*, Lee's Algorithm
